The `@keyframes` rule in CSS is used to define a set of keyframes or intermediate stages of an animation. It allows you to specify how an element should be styled at various points during the animation.

Here's a breakdown of how `@keyframes` works:

Syntax: The `@keyframes` rule is written with the `@keyframes` keyword, followed by a name for the animation (e.g., `@keyframes myAnimation`).

Keyframe Stages: Inside the `@keyframes` rule, you define multiple stages or keyframes of the animation using percentages (0% to 100%) or specific keywords (`from` and `to`). Each keyframe represents a specific point in the animation timeline.

Styling: For each keyframe, you specify the CSS styles that should be applied to the element at that particular stage. You can define any CSS properties and values to create the desired visual effect.

Animation Property: To apply the defined animation to an element, you use the `animation` property in CSS. You reference the name of the animation defined with `@keyframes` and set additional animation-related properties like duration, timing function, delay, and iteration count.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of `@keyframes`:

```css
@keyframes myAnimation {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

.element {
  animation-name: myAnimation;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```

In this example, `@keyframes` myAnimation defines a keyframe animation with three stages: at 0%, 50%, and 100% of the animation's duration. Each stage specifies different CSS properties, such as `opacity` and `transform`, to create a fade-in and fade-out effect with scaling. The `.element` class references this animation using the `animation-name` property and sets other animation-related properties.

By using `@keyframes`, you can define complex animations with multiple stages and precise control over styling at each keyframe.
