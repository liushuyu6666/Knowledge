# Create a React app
To create a React app, navigate to a folder in the terminal and run the following command using `npx`:
```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
```
This will download and execute the `create-react-app` package without the need for a global installation, creating a new React app named `my-app` with the source code of a React app. To create one written in TypeScript, you can issue this command instead:
```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
