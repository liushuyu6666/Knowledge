Microservices is an architectural approach where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and operates as a separate and autonomous unit.

For example, in a Spring Boot + MongoDB + static storage scenario, the application can be decomposed into the following microservices:

Product Service: This microservice handles the logic related to managing products, such as creating, updating, and retrieving product information. It exposes RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on products.

User Service: This microservice handles user management functionalities, including user registration, authentication, and profile management. It provides APIs for user-related operations.

Image Service: This microservice deals with storing and retrieving images associated with products. It provides APIs for uploading, retrieving, and serving product images.

Catalog Service: This microservice combines the functionalities of the product service and the image service to provide a unified catalog view. It integrates with both services to fetch product information and associated images to construct the catalog.

Each of these microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing different teams to focus on specific functionalities without being tightly coupled. They communicate with each other through lightweight protocols, such as HTTP/REST, messaging queues, or event-driven mechanisms.
