# Overview
Java projects require a dependency configuration file to manage their dependencies. The format and location of this file may vary, as it is typically generated by the project's build automation tool or integrated development environment (IDE). As such, it is important to verify the file format and location for each individual project.

# Dependency Configuration File
## File Name and location
The **automation build tools** use a file called a `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle) under the root directory to declare dependencies and other build settings.  

The **IntelliJ IDEA** generates an `XML` file in the `.idea/libraries` directory that describes the library's settings, including its name, path, and any additional configuration options.  
When you import a project into `IntelliJ IDEA`, it automatically generates a default build configuration file (`pom.xml` or `build.gradle`) based on the project's build system, even if the project **does not have one**. This means that you can import projects without a `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file, or if one was not initially created for the project. This default configuration file can then be further customized as needed.
