# Overview
Two popular Java-based libraries for building AWS cloud applications are `AWS SDK` and `Spring Cloud for AWS`.  

`Spring Cloud for AWS` offers a higher-level integration with AWS services and features such as **auto-configuration** for simpler setup. `AWS SDK`, on the other hand, allows more control over the integration with AWS services.
