# Overview

npx is used to execute `Node.js` packages that are installed **locally** or **available online** without having to install them globally on your system.

**Locally**: `npx` provides a way to run executable files that are included in `npm` packages. This is particularly useful for running tools like `Babel` or `ESLint`, which can be installed as `npm` packages and then run using `npx`.

**Available online**: `npx` allows you to run packages that are not installed on your machine, but are available on the npm registry, by downloading them on the fly and running them in your terminal. This can be useful for testing out new packages or running one-off scripts without having to install anything permanently.
